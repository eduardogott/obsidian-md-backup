# 💫 Feeling: 
> She's an old fried that I keep remembering of.

---

## 🌱 Description
I've been remembering her every now and then. I don't know why but it keeps hjappening.
I've dreamed with her so many times already. And the crazy thing is that it started to happen way after the friendship ended, maybe more than a year later.
The dreams aren't anything strange, sexual, in some we aren't even friends but her face appears nice and clear as someone else.
Some random memories keep coming about, remembering the time we were tohether at her family's ranch, random things we did in school, random days that I was in her home, like the day we made a model of the aqueduct.
